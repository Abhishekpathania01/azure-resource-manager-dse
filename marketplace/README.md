This template is specifically for Azure Marketplace deployments.  It contains a Create UI Definition file and other Azure Marketplace specific artifacts not included in the simple template.

This template is not intended to be deployed standalone, but rather zipped and submitted to the Azure Publish Portal.  If you want this, use the singledc template instead.

The UI definition can be tested by following this [link](https://portal.azure.com/?clientOptimizations=false#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Compute/CreateMultiVmWizardBlade/internal_bladeCallId/anything/internal_bladeCallerParams/{"initialData":{},"providerConfig":{"createUiDefinition":"https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDSPN%2Fazure-resource-manager-dse%2Fmaster%2Fmarketplace%2FcreateUiDefinition.json"}})
